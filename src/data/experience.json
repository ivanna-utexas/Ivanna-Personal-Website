We worked on programming an anomaly based model that used K-means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model, and One Class Classifiers. Our Model had good results under Accuracy, Recall, and precision which improved the real world case of zero-day threats. We presented our findings to a panel of family and UTD Staff.",
